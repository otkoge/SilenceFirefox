Silencing Firefox to reduce the noise in the proxy during webapp pentesting                                    

During web application pentests Firefox can be a bit chatty, filling the proxy history with unecesarry noise. Using this user.js reduces this noise significantly.

## Never use it in a browser that you actively use to browse. This is for a browser that you only use for pentesting. I have disabled a lot of security features that you'd want during everyday browsing.
